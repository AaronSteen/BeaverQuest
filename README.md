## Development

### Modern Project Structure

The project has been reorganized to follow Python best practices for game development:

```
newgame/
â”œâ”€â”€ src/newgame/           # Main game package
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ config/            # Game settings and constants
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ settings.py    # Configurable game parameters
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ constants.py   # Static game constants
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ core/              # Core game systems
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ game.py        # Main game class and loop
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ game_state.py  # Game state management
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ entities/          # Game objects
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ player.py      # Player (beaver) character
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ objects.py     # Lodge, dam, and other objects
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ food.py        # Food system and items
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ systems/           # Game systems
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ ui.py          # User interface and HUD
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ utils/             # Utility functions
â”‚       â””â”€â”€ math.py        # Math and collision utilities
â”œâ”€â”€ tests/                 # Test suite
â”œâ”€â”€ docs/                  # Documentation and screenshots
â”œâ”€â”€ scripts/               # Development scripts
â””â”€â”€ examples/              # Example code and demos
```

### Development Environment Setup

#### Automated Setup (Recommended)

**On macOS/Linux:**
```bash
./setup_env.sh
```

**On Windows:**
```cmd
setup_env.bat
```

#### Manual Setup

```bash
# Create virtual environment
python -m venv venv

# Activate environment
source venv/bin/activate  # macOS/Linux
# or
venv\Scripts\activate     # Windows

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Running the Game

Several ways to run the game:

```bash
# Development mode (recommended during development)
python scripts/run_game.py

# Direct module execution
python -m newgame.main

# Installed package (after pip install -e .)
newgame
```

### Testing

```bash
# Install development dependencies
pip install -e .[dev]

# Run tests
pytest

# Run with coverage
pytest --cov=newgame --cov-report=html
```

### Code Quality

```bash
# Format code
black src/ tests/

# Check style
flake8 src/ tests/
```

## Requirements

- **Python**: 3.8+ (3.12.3 recommended)
- **Pygame**: 2.5.0+
- **Development Tools**: pytest, black, flake8 (for contributors)

## Key Improvements in New Structure

1. **Proper Python Package**: Installable package under `src/newgame/`
2. **Separation of Concerns**: Clear separation between config, core systems, entities, and utilities
3. **Scalability**: Easy to add new systems (audio, graphics, networking) later
4. **Testing**: Dedicated test structure with room to grow
5. **Modern Configuration**: Uses `pyproject.toml` for modern Python project standards
6. **Documentation**: Centralized docs with organized screenshots
